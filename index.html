      <h1>The use of Force Against Hamas</h1>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <h3>World War One</h3>
      <p>
	After the collapse of the Ottoman empire, people like Theodore Herzl wanted to create a Jewish state where their
	ancestors once lived. This is called Zionism. After World War One, Zionists convinced the Brittish
	and League of nations to place a mandate over the area of
	Palestine called the Balfour Declaration. However, the mandate brought with it some problems. The local arab population opposed the mandate
	and Palestinians revolted in the Arab Revolt of 1936-39. The British government shipped thousands of troops while
	the local Jewish population created a militia called the Haganah (although not allowed by the British).
      </p>

      <h3>World War Two</h3>
      <p>
	In World War Two, many Jews were escaping Nazi rule because of the Holocaust. However the British government
	decided to restrict Jewish migration to the mandate because Palestinians rejected a multiple state solution
	with "Jewish and Arab states" (“Israel - Jewish Homeland, Zionism, 1948 | Britannica”). Yet, after the war the UN decided to create a two state solution in
	Palestine (a two state solution is one Arab and one Jewish). The Arabs in the region continued to be against the
	two state solution and revolted again. A nationalist called "Hajj Amin al-Husseini" led Arabs to attack
	Jews in the mandate which sparked a Zionist group called the "Stern Gang" that broke apart from the "Irgun
	Zvai Leumi" movement to attack a Palestinian village called "Deir-Yassin" that killed 100 people.
      </p>
      
      
      <h3>The War of 1948</h3>
      <p>
	Israel finally declared independence in May of 1948. However, the Arab population didn't like this at all. In the war of 1948, the surrounding Arab nations attacked Israel (“Milestones in the History of U.S. Foreign Relations - Office of the Historian”). The states of "Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Transjordan" joined that attack to fight Israel. Yet,
	the through the use of "militias" like the "Stern Gang" and "Irgun Tzvei Le'umi," rivalries between arab states, "conflicting goals," and the first ceasefire that allowed Israelis to recuperate gave the Israelis a victory that gained them "one-fifth more territory than the original partition plan" (“Israel - Armistice, Refugees, Conflict | Britannica”, Aljazeera).
