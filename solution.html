      <h1>Is the retaliation by Israel after October 7th Justified?</h1>

      <h2>The answer</h2>
      <h3>So many deaths</h3>
      <p>This conflict is a hard topic to answer because there are many civilian deaths on both sides. In Gaza, bombings have costed the deaths of “23,812 Palestinian civilians” this year (Egypt Today). There's also a lot of starving in that region because of the lack of aid. However, the answer to this question is not about if Israel is justified in killing <i>civilians</i> but instead about Hamas. Israel currently claims that they're against Hamas and not civilians, but if it turns out that Israel is killing civilians on purpose then of course they would be unjustified.</p>
      <h3>Context</h3>
      <p>For this specific war, see the context <a href="problem.html">here</a></p>

      <h3>Why are there so many civilian deaths?</h3>
      <p>This is explained by the very long tunnels that Hamas has. The total length of the tunnels are almost half the length of i35 in Texas (Arranz et al.). Because the tunnels are so long, they tend to go through places like Hospitals and schools which lead to more civilian deaths.</p>
